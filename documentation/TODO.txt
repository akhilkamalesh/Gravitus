MVP 1 TODO 

Based off Screens/Components:

Data:
- Consolidate data entries to either be plural or singular for all (consistency)

Based Off Codebase (Low Priority):

- Clean up firestoreFunctions.tsx (Modularize)
- Fix firestore warnings (medium priority)
- Create components for reusable code (ie scrollview, safeareaview, ...)
- Styling Edits -> Should all be the same css for everything
