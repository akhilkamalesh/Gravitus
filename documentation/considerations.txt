Questions to ask to form a product risk registry on an existing product:
- Where are there areas of ambiguity or uncertainty as to how the solution should function
- Where are there complexities, or things that are difficult to understand and comprehend
- What required functionality has not been created or tested with an end user
- What is blocking the end-user from achieving their desired objectives
- Where are there aspects or characteristics of the solution that would cause it to fail
- Where are we not clear abou whether or not the user would react positively
- What solution features or workflows are still pain points for the end user

Product risks can be identified as large segments of the user workflow, or even at the individual feature level
Risks should be framed as implementation free description of the underlying problem
    - This specific feature is difficult or cumbersome for the user to navigate through and use
    - There is a missing part of the solution's workflow that is necessary for the user to achieve their goal and solve their problem
