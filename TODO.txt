MVP 1 TODO 

Based off Screens/Components:

Two (High Priority):
- Simulator "Weight"/"Reps" should be pulled from last time that exercise was logged

    Need a function that grabs log based of ExerciseID (done)
    Need a useEffect that is triggered when exercise is rendered to grab lastloggedset set, lb, rep for each exercise
    Load that as default into the TextInput

Exercises (Medium Priority):
- UI Changes: make it match the rest of the formatting
    - use of floating box for details
- Chart: Clickable points that show the actual one rep max
- Floating Box for additional details @ the bottom

Index Page (Low Priority):
- UI additions to floating boxes

Training Splits (Low Priority):
- Add detailed information about current split within [id]
- Add a discard split button @ bottom of the page with confirmation
- Finish writing script for Upper/Lower

History (Low/No Priority):
- Edit filter to be splitName rather than splitId

Weekly Progress (No Priority):
- Figure out algorithm to track how many workouts were done this week
- Display in nice graph: https://nearform.com/open-source/victory-native/

Goals/PRS (No Priority):
- Honestly, may remove this tab

Based Off Codebase (Low Priority):

- Clean up create.tsx
- Clean up firestoreFunctions.tsx (Modularize)
- Fix firestore warnings (medium priority)
- Create components for reusable code (ie scrollview, safeareaview, ...)
